# What ?

I have published an e-book on [Amazon Kindle Store](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRSYCRYB) that is called **Nico The Dinosaur**. All the texts have been created by [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and all the images by [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion). This is an experimental artwork.

# You are selling that ?

* I don't care about the money, every profits will be donated to GiveWell(https://www.givewell.org/) but I suspect I will get 0$
* it's only 0.99$ btw. so if you want to give 70
* It cost me 0$ to make it (only a windows, a photoshop licence and some electrity)

# Why ?

I wanted to experiment and learn. I wanted to question the boundaries of the creations, of imagination, of publishing, of being an author, etc...

* Am I an author for publishing a book ?
* Should Amazon Kindle Store let people publish book that have been entierly created by AI ?
* Could we automate this process with an API and publish 10000 books per day automatically ?
* Does authors should fight again that kind of process ?
* Is it legal ?
* Is it a good book ?

# How ?

* I firstly ask ChatGPT to create the story in 10 parts
* I also ask ChatGPT how to publish that
* I also ask ChatGPT to create the author name
* I also ask ChatGPT to explain me how to create an e-book (because I did not know)
* Then I coppy paste every parts in StableDiffusion as a prompt using [Artbot](https://tinybots.net/artbot/info). Thanks to [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net/) it was free to use.
* I added "joyful, colorful, drawing, a young dinosaur, children's book" on every prompts + k_euler_a + 30 steps

# How much time does it took ?

* 2H : from opening ChatGPT website, putt
